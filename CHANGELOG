Patch submitted by morgajel:
Fix display issue of Update Multi command counters graph in Oracle 5.5
Support Oracle MySQL 5.6

1.2.1 - Mon Dec 31 10:04:54 MST 2012

Fix display issue of InnoDB buffer pool graph in Oracle 5.5 and Percona 5.5

1.2 - Fri Dec 21 14:21:00 MST 2012

Initial "support" of MySQL 5.5. Since I don't have a MySQL 5.5 server,
I'm flying blind with this and I hope it works. If it does not work:

1) Don't expect a quick fix
2) I will need additional information from you

1.1.2 - Sun Dec 16 14:46:02 MST 2012

fixes a problem with the InnoDB Row Lock Time graph for Percona 5.5 server.
The value was stored as a gauge instead of a counter. To manually fix a
Percona 5.5 rrd file:

rrdtool tune MYSQL_COUNTERS.rrd --data-source-type 257:COUNTER

1.1.1 - Fri Nov 16 14:48:10 MST 2012

fixes a problem with the InnoDB Checkpoint Age graph for Percona 5.5 server.
Three values were stored as counters instead of gauges. MySQL 5.1 graphs don't
need to be fixed. To manually fix a Percona 5.5 rrd file:

rrdtool tune MYSQL_COUNTERS.rrd --data-source-type 230:GAUGE --data-source-type 231:GA
UGE --data-source-type 232:GAUGE

Fixes a problem in the version detection code for 5.1

1.1 - Mon Oct 29 13:19:50 MST 2012

Initial support for Percona Server 5.5

1.0.4 - Sat Sep 22 09:15:29 MST 2012

Fix a syntax error in the templates

1.0.3 - Sat Aug 11 11:20:46 MST 2012

Some captured values were incorrectly stored as counters instead of gauges.
This is an internal correction that doesn't affect graph display.

1.0.2 - Sat Jun 30 20:06:32 MST 2012

Include a template for MySQL 5.1 without InnoDB Plugin

1.0.1 - Mon May  7 17:58:46 MST 2012

Introduce a whitelist for counters to prevent new counters from breaking existing
graphs

1.0 - initial release
